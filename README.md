# Digital Humanities for Literary Studies: POS-tagging lesson with Edinburgh Noteable
A [lesson on part-of-speech tagging](...) using the collection [A Medical History of British India](https://data.nls.uk/data/digitised-collections/a-medical-history-of-british-india/) provided by the National Library of Scotland's [Data Foundry](https://data.nls.uk) as an example.

This lesson was created by [Beatrice Alex](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-beatrice-alex) using materials from the Library Carpentries lesson on Text and Data Mining [1] and the EFI Text and Data Mining course [2]. [Anouk Lang](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/anouk-lang) also provided valuable feedback and input to the lesson.
